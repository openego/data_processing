ego_dp_powerflow_assignment_generator.sql
#########################################

Generators which were assigned to a specific substation prior to this script need to be transformed to a data structure
suitable for powerflow calculation with tool developed and used in the open_eGo project. The following script transforms 
data from the powerplant mviews and adds some parameters according to the characteristics of the generators. 
To reduce the data volumn in the final table structure (see ego_dp_powerflow_hv_setup.sql) the generators are clustered 
according to their source, installed capacity, weather point and substation they are assigned to. Here a new and unique 
aggregate-ID (aggr_id) is assigned. 
In an interims stage all generators are converted to a format suitable for powerflow flow calculation seperately. This data
can be accessed in table `model_draft.ego_supply_pf_generator_single <http://oep.iks.cs.ovgu.de/dataedit/view/model_draft/ego_supply_pf_generator_single>`_.


Information on generators which are assigned to a specific substation are transformed to a data structure which is suitable
for PyPSA. This script creates the scenarios
'Status Quo', 'NEP 2035' and 'eGo 100' in the hv powerflow schema.
