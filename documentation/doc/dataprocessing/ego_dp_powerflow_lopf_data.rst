##############################

Missing parameters necessary for calculating a linear optimal power flow (LOPF) are added to the existing data. This
includes marginal costs per technology, which is composed of specific operating cost, fuel costs and CO2 costs 
according to renpass_gis, NEP 2014 scenario. 
In addition p_max_pu is set for all generators with variable dispatch based on p_max_pu = p_set / p_nom.

A further section of the script is used to insert extendable battery and hydrogen storages to all substations in the 
grid model. These have a initial installed capacity p_nom=0, which can be extended when executing an optimization 
(by calculating a LOPF).
