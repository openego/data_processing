This package contains the scripts of the data processing for the research project
`open_eGo <https://openegoproject.wordpress.com>`_.
The data processing creates data required for grid model generators (`osmTGmod <https://github.com/openego/osmTGmod>`_
and `ding0 <https://github.com/openego/ding0>`_) and grid planning calculations conducted with
`eTraGo <https://github.com/openego/eTraGo>`_ and `eDisGo <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo>`_.


More information about the project can be found in :ref:`Open_eGo the project` and on the
`project website <https://openegoproject.wordpress.com>`_.
See :ref:`Getting started` for instructions on installation and execution.
An overview on data processing steps is given in :ref:`Data processing scripts`.
