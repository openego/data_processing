SQL Script that prepare and insert single renewable power plant data by a given
scenario in order to create a high resulution allocation renewable energy expansion.

For the project open_eGo and the tools eTraGo, eDisGo and eGo the scenarios are
named 'Status Quo' (2015), 'NEP 2035', 'eGo 100'. Learn more about the scenario here 
`scenarios here <http://data-processing.readthedocs.io/en/master/scenario.html>`_.

This script is divided into two parts:

Part I
******
- Development of new renewable power plants by NEP 2035 scenario data

Part II
*******
- Development of new renewable power plants by ego 100% scenario data


Methodology
-----------
Both parts of the script work more or less with the same Methodology of an expansion
and allocation of renewable energy plants. A full documentation of the used 
Methodology of the Renewable allocation `can be found here <http://data-processing.readthedocs.io/en/master/methodology.html>`_.
